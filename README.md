# Wordle in Python
This is a Python clone of Wordle. It uses the colorama and random libraries, so colorama must be installed on your computer.
## Installation
Download this Github project as a zip file, then unzip. Make sure colorama is installed and the file 5_letter_words.txt is in the same directory.
## How to play
- Input the number of guesses you'd like to have.
- A random word from the dictionary will be chosen.
- Until you run out of guesses:
  - Enter a word as a guess. Repeats until the guess is in the 5_leter_words.txt file. 
  - Prints out your guess with coloured letters that mean:
    - Red - Letter is not in the actual word.
    - Green - Letter is in the actual word, and is in the correct spot.
    - Yellow - Letter is in the actual word, but is in the wrong spot.
  - Use the information given to guess the next word until you get it right or run out of guesses.
